        <h1>Core Text Objective-C Wrapper</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>One of the most promising and mysterious new frameworks introduced in
iOS 3.2 is Core Text. Apple defines Core Text as a “text drawing
engine”, which allows Mac (and now iPad) apps to render rich text on any
graphics context. Strings drawn with Core Text feature lots of custom
settings such as detailed font information, columns, variable line and
paragraph heights and several different attributes, which designers and
font aficionados surely understand much better than I do. Many new apps
have been using this framework since the release of the iPad,
particularly newspapers and ebook reader applications, rendering
gorgeous text in custom fonts, many of them not available natively in
iOS. This framework is also used in lifestyle and corporate
applications, too, where using a custom font is sometimes required to
match the specifications of brands and trademarks.</p>

<p>It is very important to understand that Core Text is really just a text
drawing engine to be used on top of Quartz (Core Graphics), to render
rich text on any graphics context. Core Text cannot be used to create a
rich text editor, for example, so don’t expect to extend UITextView with
it. But you can use it to draw any kind of rich text on screen, which
can make you avoid using UIWebView instances for that.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting capabilities of Core Text is being able to
render text in several columns. However, Core Text is a C-based
framework, and I think that understanding and using the concepts and
structures required to render text in columns can be particularly
tricky. To make the my life and that of my fellow developers easier,
this project contains a small set of Objective-C classes that
encapsulate the creation of framesetters, attributed strings and other
constructions, and takes care of the creation of several columns, as
well as the division of the text in several pages if required.</p>

<p>The API interface is very simple (on purpose) and I’m pretty sure you’ll
be able to integrate it very easily in your own projects, particularly
if you look at the sample project where the classes are used. I’ve also
added a category for UIFont, that returns the associated CTFontRef
pointer, in a similar fashion to UIImage, which is able to return a
pointer to the underlying CGImageRef pointer. It also allows to create a
CTFontRef from any font embedded in the application bundle. I am puzzled
that the framework designers haven’t included this by default in UIKit.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>

<p>A future extension I’d like to add would be a couple of categories to
parse simple RTF or HTML strings (to start with, probably just with bold
and italic text) and create the appropriate attributed string from it;
there’s a couple of AppKit extensions to NSAttributedString that do
exactly that, but for the moment they are only available in the Mac
version of Cocoa, and I haven’t found anything similar for iOS yet.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>The following people have helped this project grow, with pull requests,
comments or bug reports:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://github.com/JaredCrawford">Jared Crawford</a> contributed
support for shadows in AKOCustomFontLabel.</li>
<li>  <a href="http://www.tapwork.de">Christian Menschel</a> contributed the
AKOMultiColumnTextViewDataSource protocol to add custom views in the
text columns.</li>
</ul><h2>License</h2>

<p>The code, as usual, is available through with BSD license (see the
LICENSE file), so feel free to use it and even contribute bug fixes or
enhancements if you want. The font embedded in the project is Polsku
Regula, <a href="http://openfontlibrary.org/files/ospublish/140">available through the Open Font
Library.org</a>. The
project requires Xcode 3.2.3 and the iOS SDK 4.0, and it creates a
simple application that works on the iPad (iOS 3.2). As usual, use it at
your own risk. Enjoy!</p>
